# Main Core Python Script

This script is part of a larger project that simulates the decision-making process of the Magi System from the Neon Genesis Evangelion series. The script creates a `Crew` object, which represents the Magi System, and assigns it a set of tasks to perform.

## Code Overview

The script begins by defining a `Task` object, `strategy_task`, which represents a strategic plan formulation based on current threats. The expected output of this task is a comprehensive defense strategy.

Next, a `Crew` object, `magi_system`, is created. This object represents the Magi System, which is composed of three supercomputers: Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar. These supercomputers are represented as `agents` in the `Crew` object. The `Crew` is also assigned a set of tasks, which includes `diplomacy_task`, `scientific_analysis_task`, and `strategy_task`.

The decision-making process of the `Crew` is set to be consensual, meaning that all agents (supercomputers) must agree on the decision.

Finally, the `Crew` is kicked off with some initial data, and the result of the decision-making process is printed.

## Evangelion Lore

In the Neon Genesis Evangelion series, the Magi System is a trio of supercomputers developed by Dr. Naoko Akagi of NERV. Each supercomputer represents a different aspect of Dr. Akagi's personality: Caspar represents her as a woman, Melchior represents her as a scientist, and Balthasar represents her as a mother. The Magi System is used to make all major decisions within NERV, and its consensus-based decision-making process is a key element of the series.
