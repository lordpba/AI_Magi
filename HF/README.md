# 🔺 MAGI System v2.0

![MAGI System](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lordpba/AI_Magi/main/example_gui.png)

## 🧬 What is MAGI?

**MAGI System** is a multi-agent AI inspired by the legendary supercomputers of Neon Genesis Evangelion. Three distinct AI personalities—Melchior (logic), Balthasar (ethics), Casper (practicality)—analyze every question from different angles, then synthesize their answers for a true "consensus of minds".

> *"The truth lies in the synthesis of three perspectives."*

MAGI is the digital soul of NERV: scientific, ethical, and pragmatic. Now you can ask it anything—just like Gendo Ikari.

## 🧠 How MAGI Works

1. **Ask a question** (Evangelion, AI, ethics, anything!)
2. **Choose your LLM provider** (Groq recommended - it's free!)
3. **MAGI splits your question** into three perspectives:
   - 🔬 **Melchior**: Scientific/logical analysis
   - 🛡️ **Balthasar**: Ethical/emotional evaluation
   - ⚖️ **Casper**: Practical/social assessment
4. **Synthesis**: The system merges all three analyses for a complete answer
